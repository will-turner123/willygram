# Willygram

> The coolest social media platform!

Willygram is a social media web app built with Django using Python & JavaScript. Users can register to post, follow users, comment on posts, message users and much more. Willygram is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes. [View a live demo here](https://willygram.willturner.tech)

# Features
## Explore Page
![Explore Page](https://github.com/will-turner123/willygram/blob/main/img/explore.png?raw=true)
On the Explore page, logged in users are able to see the 100 most popular recent posts. Posts are sorted with a custom post weighting algorithm. Posts on the explore page are "scored" with ((likes * 1) + ( comments * 2) - (days ago posted * 2)). This way, recent and popular or controversial posts are shown first on the explore page. 

## Alerts
![Alerts](https://github.com/will-turner123/willygram/blob/main/img/alerts.png?raw=true)

Users will be notified when a user messages them, follows them, likes their post or comments on their post. Notifications will display as unread at the top unless they have been marked as read.
